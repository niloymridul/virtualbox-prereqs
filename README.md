<h1>VirtualBox - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the virtual machines through VirtualBox<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VirtualBox (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Kali Linux
- Windows 10
  
<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Computer or Laptop
- At least 25 GB of space to spare
- 6 GB of ram to spare
- Good and steady internet connection to download heavy files
- The ability to turn on virtualization.

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
Virtualbox is a virtualizer that is used for both servers and desktops. A virtualizer simply put is software that loads the equivalent of computers on your computer. You can load various OS (operating systems) and have them interact with each other. And because it's not physical hardware you can also destroy them as well. All within one computer.

With this in mind, we will plan on downloading and configuring it for this lab. But first, you will need to make sure you have a computer that can handle virtualization.

- Computer or Laptop
- At least 25 GB of space to spare
- 6 GB of ram to spare
- Good and steady internet connection to download heavy files
- The ability to turn on virtualization.

<p>
If you think your PC has all of the requirements then we will do the last step before downloading the software. First, you will need to enable virtualization. By turning this on, your computer will be able to create virtual machines on your pc. This is within your NETBIOS and boot settings of your pc.

Once that is out of the way, we can start by clicking the link below.

This link should take you to the VirtualBox website where you can download the package for the host computer(your PC's operating system and the actual hardware) and click on the exe file that is downloaded. Hit yes.

Afterward, click next to start configuring and then click browse to see where you want to store it. Then click yes and start installing the program. When you finish you will need to download the two virtual machines. Click on both of the links and download them in a safe location.
